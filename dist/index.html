              Different people have different hobbies: someone makes vlogs for
              Instagram, others bake cakes worthy of participating in the GBBO,
              and others grow a collection of cacti. But if you ask about my
              hobby, I will tell you my passion is to study.
              <p>
                I believe that the learning process does not end when a person
                receives a diploma at the graduation ceremony, it continues
                throughout one's life. Some knowledge and skills need to be
                constantly updated because we live in a rapidly changing world.
                Some people have to change jobs in midlife due to layoffs,
                unforeseen pandemics, burnout, or moving to another country
                where your skills become irrelevant, as it was in my case.

            <article class="text">
              I believe that online education platforms offer a great
              opportunity to try a new profession from the comfort of your home.
              I get acquainted with popular online-learning platforms like
              Coursera and EDX, I learned online how to write articles and
              improved my language skills. But nothing gives me as much pleasure
              as learning programming. Despite the fact that this is the most
              difficult thing that I have done in my life, it is also the most
              rewarding. Programming allows me instantly see the result of my
              actions and feel Eureka Moment every time I try to solve a puzzle.

              <p>
                Over the years of self-education, I realized what kind of
                learning style is right for me - I work well individually and in
                a team, and memorize information best of all thanks to the
                spaced repetition and its immediate application in practice.
                Same approach is used by the language learning app Duolingo. I
                also believe that a similar approach can be implemented when
                learning a programming language. I think that my past learning
                experience will help me successfully complete the CodeYourFuture
                course.

            <h2 class="subteg">New Technology</h2>
            <article class="text">
              I believe that new technologies inevitably penetrate all areas of
              life and then become an integral part of life. For example, Zoom,
              Slack, GoogleDocs, and many more allowed people living in
              different parts of the world to collaborate as if they were
              sitting in the same office. All of this has become possible thanks
              to software developers who create these products disrupting the
              market.

              <p>
                However, not only does younger generations benefit from new tech: some
                traditional industries such as agriculture uses new technologies
                to their advantage: by processing large amounts of weather and
                crop data, it is possible to make a fairly accurate forecast for
                the upcoming season and measures needed to improve yield.
              </p>

              <p>
                The humorous video, which can be found on the right, tells how
                in the near future any ordinary farmer will be forced to get to
                know more about robots and computer technology.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thinking about the future, I understand that I want to be one of
                those who change the world for the better - to be part of a
                company that develops products and technologies that, possibly,
                will disrupt the market or simply make people's everyday life
                better.
